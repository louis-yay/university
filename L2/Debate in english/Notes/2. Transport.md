    - Con: It can cost more than gasoline one
    - Con: Baterie disposal is still a problem in some cases.
- Other liquid fuels:
    - Pro: Can be made using carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, making a circular production and not adding any more CO2 in the air.
    - Con: It’s less dense in energie than gasoline, storage have to be bigger and the passager have to refuel more regulary
- Biofuel:
    - Pro: CO2 free
    - Con: more expensive than gasoline alternative
